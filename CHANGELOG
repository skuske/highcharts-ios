# Version 11.1.0

## Framework:

1. Added support for mouse wheel zooming through chart.zooming.mouseWheel. This feature is embedded in the Highcharts Stock bundle, but requires an additional module file for the Highcharts bundle.
2. Added the heatmap.interpolation option for creating smooth heatmaps.
3. Added new function, Chart.getOptions(), to get the current active configuration options for the chart.
4. Added the treegraph.fillSpace option for treegraphs to fill the whole plot area even when some points are collaped.
5. Added `borderRadius` option support for funnel and pyramid series. See #18839.
6. Added new option, xAxis.crossing and yAxis.crossing, making it easier to create axis layout for mathematical plots.
7. Added new option, series.legendSymbol. See #18753.
8. Design facelift with clearer, more vivid palette, added contrast for text labels and many minor visual changes.
9. Added new series type, treegraph. Read more in the docs.
10. Added new series type, pictorial.
11. Removed support for IE 8 and older.
12. Changed the default builds to ECMAScript version ES2016.
13. Replaced SASS files for styledMode with updated CSS files. Highcharts theming is now easier by supporting CSS variables as well as `prefers-color-scheme`. See style by CSS.
14. Sonification module v2 with many new features for audio charts, now part of the official API.
15. Changed default rotationMode to `circular` for sunburst data labels.
16. Added minorTicksPerMajor option for axes, see #13338.
17. Added the `point.percentage` property for gauge charts, see #18433.
18. Added `ResizeObserver` to the chart so it could adjust reflow on container size change, closes #17924.

## Framework upgrade notes:
1. To revert to the old design, use the theme defined in the v10 theme sample.
2. Font sizes of the chart are now using rem by default. This may cause too small or too big fonts if your web page is using non-default root element font size. To avoid that, set chart.style.fontSize to 16px or any other values you see fit.
3. The top-level labels option has been deprecated for a long time and is now removed. Use Annotations instead.
4. Time-related settings on the global options structure are removed. Use the time options instead.
5. The new version of the sonification module is not backwards compatible with the old, experimental module.
6. The default builds were changed to ECMAScript version ES2016. See the system requirements on how to support IE11 and other legacy browsers.
7. If you're using chart.styledMode, and your end users have prefers-color-scheme set to dark in their browsers, they may now be presented with dark-themed charts. The exception is if your CSS overrides the default coloring.
8. Changed default rotationMode to circular for sunburst data labels.

3. Added internal support for Google Sheets API v4, fixing stability problems with loading data from spreadsheets.

## Framework upgrade notes:

1. Existing setups with Google Sheets stopped working in August 2021 as Google phased out version 3 of their Google Sheets API. Highcharts has now been upgraded to version 4 of the API, but this will not work unless an API key is given in the data.googleAPIKey option. See the `comprehensive tutorial` from Hands-On Data Visualization on how to obtain the key. Additionally, `data.googleSpreadsheetWorksheet` is deprecated and replaced by `data.googleSpreadsheetRange`, which allows for more detailed instructions on what data to load.

# Version 8.1.0

## iOS:

1. Fixed #306, #309, Custom fonts bug.
2. Added XCFramework support.

## Framework:

1. Added vertical panning to Highcharts. The `chart.panning.type` now accepts `y` directions.
2. Added box options for `yAxis.stackLabels`: `backgroundColor`, `borderWidth`, `borderRadius` and `borderColor`. See #13330.
3. Added new series label options, `series.label.format` and `series.label.formatter`.
4. Added individual dash style settings for various parts of box plots. See #13065.
5. Added language options for export-data table text, see #13166.

## Framework upgrade notes:

1. The Axis class was refactored as part of the TypeScript migration. Axis extensions like log axis, broken axis, parallel axis, datetime axis and ordinal axis are now handled as compositions. Instead of adding multiple properties to the main axis instance, they now add a single object that holds all properties. This does not affect the options API, but it may affect implementations that are based on some of our samples that used the original properties. Our samples have been updated to use the new structure.
2. For added type safety, we are now defining SVG path definition as two-dimensional arrays, or in TypeScript sense an array of tuples. So `['M', 0, 0, 'L', 100, 100]` in the new implementation should be written `[['M', 0, 0], ['L', 100, 100]]`. We built in a converter for old paths, but there may be cases, like for example directly accessing `SVGRenderer.crispLine`, where it breaks.
