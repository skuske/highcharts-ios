What data values to map the parameter within. Mapping within `"series"` will make the lowest value point in the series map to the min audio parameter value, and the highest value will map to the max audio parameter. Mapping within `"chart"` will make the lowest value point in the whole chart map to the min audio parameter value, and the highest value in the whole chart will map to the max audio parameter. You can also map within the X or Y axis of each series.
