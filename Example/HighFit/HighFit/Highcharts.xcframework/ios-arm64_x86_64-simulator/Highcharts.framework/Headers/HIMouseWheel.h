Decides in what dimensions the user can zoom scrolling the wheel. Can be one of `x`, `y` or `xy`. If not specified here, it will inherit the type from `chart.zooming.type`. Note that particularly with mouse wheel in the y direction, the zoom is affected by the default `yAxis.startOnTick` and `endOnTick`) settings. In order to respect these settings, the zoom level will adjust after the user has stopped zooming. To prevent this, consider setting `startOnTick` and `endOnTick` to `false`.

**Accepted values:** `["x", "y", "xy"]`.

**Defaults to** `x`.
