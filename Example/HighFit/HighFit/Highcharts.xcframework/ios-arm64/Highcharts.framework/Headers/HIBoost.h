/**
Options for the Boost module. The Boost module allows certain series types to be rendered by WebGL instead of the default SVG. This allows hundreds of thousands of data points to be rendered in milliseconds. In addition to the WebGL rendering it saves time by skipping processing and inspection of the data wherever possible. This introduces some limitations to what features are available in boost mode. See [the docs](https://www.highcharts.com/docs/advanced-chart-features/boost-module) for details. In addition to the global `boost` option, each series has a `boostThreshold` that defines when the boost should kick in. Requires the `modules/boost.js` module.

**Try it**

* [Line chart](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/boost/line)
* [Line chart with hundreds of series](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/boost/line-series-heavy)
* [Scatter chart](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/boost/scatter)
* [Area chart](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/boost/area)
* [Area range chart](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/boost/arearange)
* [Column chart](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/boost/column)
* [Column range chart](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/boost/columnrange)
* [Bubble chart](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/boost/bubble)

The pixel ratio for the WebGL content. If 0, the `window.devicePixelRatio` is used. This ensures sharp graphics on high DPI displays like Apple's Retina, as well as when a page is zoomed. The default is left at 1 for now, as this is a new feature that has the potential to break existing setups. Over time, when it has been battle tested, the intention is to set it to 0 by default. Another use case for this option is to set it to 2 in order to make exported and upscaled charts render sharp. One limitation when using the `pixelRatio` is that the line width of graphs is scaled down. Since the Boost module currently can only render 1px line widths, it is scaled down to a thin 0.5 pixels on a Retina display.

**Defaults to** `1`.
