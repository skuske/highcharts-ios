/**
Define a condition for when a track should be active and not. Can either be a function callback or a configuration object. If a function is used, it should return a `boolean` for whether or not the track should be active. The function is called for each audio event, and receives a parameter object with `time`, and potentially `point` and `value` properties depending on the track. `point` is available if the audio event is related to a data point. `value` is available if the track is used as a context track, and `valueInterval` is used.
