Mapping options for the audio parameters. All parameters can be either: - A string, referencing a point property to map to. - A number, setting the value of the audio parameter directly. - A callback function, returning the value programmatically. - An object defining detailed configuration of the mapping. If a function is used, it should return the desired value for the audio parameter. The function is called for each audio event to be played, and receives a context object parameter with `time`, and potentially `point` and `value` depending on the track. `point` is available if the audio event is related to a data point, and `value` is available if the track is used for a context track using `valueInterval`.
