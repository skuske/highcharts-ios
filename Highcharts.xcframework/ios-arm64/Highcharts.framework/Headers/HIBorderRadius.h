The corner radius of the border surrounding each column or bar. A number signifies pixels. A percentage string, like for example `50%`, signifies a relative size. For columns this is relative to the column width, for pies it is relative to the radius and the inner radius.

**Defaults to** `3`.

**Try it**

* [Rounded columns](https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/highcharts/plotoptions/column-borderradius/)
